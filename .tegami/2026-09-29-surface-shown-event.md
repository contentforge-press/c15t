### Report banner impressions and time to decision

Report banner and dialog impressions, not only choices. The kernel emits a `surface:shown` event when the banner or the dialog becomes visible and records the first impression time of each surface in `snapshot.surfaceShownAt`, so a late subscriber can still read it. Provider callbacks gain `onSurfaceShown` (React and Vue/Nuxt `callbacks.onSurfaceShown`); `@c15t/browser` dispatches `c15t:surfaceShown`; dev-tools log the event. A recorded choice now carries `timeToDecisionMs` (impression to action) on the `choice:recorded` event, on `onChoiceRecorded`, and on the saved consent as `metadata.timeToDecisionMs`. `kernel.commands.save()` accepts a `uiSource` override, and the React `uiSource` prop now reaches the save payload, so `ConsentWidget` saves are attributed to `widget` instead of the active banner. The never-fired `onBannerFetched` callback and `OnBannerFetchedPayload` type are removed.

`kernel.markLive()` is public: an adapter that renders from a server-resolved prefetch and never calls `init()` calls it after hydration, so the server-rendered banner still counts as an impression. The core runtime, the React provider (and so Next.js and TanStack Start) and the Vue runtime (and so Nuxt) do this; before, an SSR page with a resolved prefetch never emitted `surface:shown`.

`consentAction` on a saved choice now stays `all` or `necessary` when the host displays only a subset of the policy scope (`consentCategories`). It names the action the visitor took; `confirmed` names the categories it covered. Before, a narrowed accept-all was recorded as `custom`.

A choice saved while a `notice` prompt is owed now records the notice dismissal with it. Before, a visitor who opened the preference center from an opt-out notice and rejected was shown the notice again.
