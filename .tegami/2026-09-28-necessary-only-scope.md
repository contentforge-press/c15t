### Show only necessary when a site declares no categories

A site that declares no categories, through `consentCategories`, scripts, network rules, vendors or discovered frames, now offers only Strictly necessary under a permissive policy, as in v2. The banner still appears when the policy asks for a choice. Accept all, Reject all and Save each record an acknowledgement that keeps the banner dismissed after reload, and hosted and manifest modes send a consent receipt for necessary alone. The acknowledgement expires with the policy's choice validity or a policy change, and a category declared later asks again. Strict policies and IAB TCF policies still offer their whole scope.

The Astro server now judges a visitor against the categories the page's `consentCategories`, `scripts` and network rules declare, so it renders the same banner decision as the browser. Browser `hasConsented()` and the `after-consent` trigger treat the acknowledgement as a decision.

In React Native, the Swift and Kotlin cores apply the same rule when the app sets no `consentCategories`: a permissive policy offers only Necessary, any save records the acknowledgement and sends the necessary-only receipt, and strict policies still offer their whole scope. A declared list now also narrows what Accept all and Reject all confirm, as on the web.
