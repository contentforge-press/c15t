### Resolve a relative backendURL against the request, not forwarding headers

A relative `backendURL` or `manifestURL` no longer resolves against client-controlled forwarding headers. The server helpers previously built the backend origin from `x-forwarded-host`, `x-forwarded-proto` or `referer` when present, so a request that set them could make the server send its `/init` or manifest request, with the request's cookies and forwarded headers, to another host.

A relative URL now resolves against the URL the framework resolved the request under (`event.url` in SvelteKit, `request.url` in Next.js route handlers, TanStack Start and Astro), or against the `host` header where no request URL exists (Next.js `resolveConsent`, `fetchSSRData`). A bare `host` resolves over `https` for a domain name and over `http` for `localhost`, an IP address, or a single-label host such as `app:3000`. The `referer` header is no longer used.

Apps behind a proxy that sets forwarding headers and drops incoming ones can opt back in with `trustForwardedHeaders: true` on SvelteKit `loadConsent` and `resolveConsent`, Next.js `resolveConsent`, `createNextConsentRouteHandlers` and `createPagesApiHandlers`, and `@c15t/react/server` `fetchSSRData` and `normalizeBackendURL`, matching the existing TanStack Start option. The rule lives in `resolveRequestBackendURL` and `resolveRequestOrigin`, new exports of `@c15t/core/server`, which every server adapter now shares. With the option set, the forwarded host and the forwarded scheme apply independently, so a proxy that keeps `host` and only sets `x-forwarded-proto` or `x-forwarded-ssl` still decides the scheme.

The SvelteKit and `@c15t/react/server` helpers also stop passing the client's `forwarded`, `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers to the backend, including when `forwardHeaders` names them in SvelteKit. `extractRelevantHeaders` in both packages leaves them out unless called with `{ trustForwardedHeaders: true }`. `fetchSSRData` still makes its `/init` request when those headers are the only ones besides `host`; it just does not forward them.

`resolveBackendURL` from `@c15t/schema/types` is deprecated in favor of `resolveRequestBackendURL`. It now follows the same rule by default: it reads only the `host` header, and ignores `x-forwarded-*` and `referer` unless its new third argument is `{ trustForwardedHeaders: true }`, which restores the previous resolution order. The forwarded values are now validated like `host`: the first entry of a comma-separated list is used, a scheme other than `http` or `https` is ignored, and a host that is not a bare authority resolves to `null`.
