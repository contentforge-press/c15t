### Add CSS variables for the "Secured by" tag

Restyle the branding tag on the banner and dialog with `--consent-branding-tag-background-color`, `--consent-branding-tag-border-color`, `--consent-branding-tag-text-color`, `--consent-branding-tag-mark-color` and `--consent-branding-tag-shadow`. `--consent-branding-tag-attached-edge-width` draws a border on the edge where the tag meets the card, which has none by default.

Without these variables set, the tag looks the same as before.
