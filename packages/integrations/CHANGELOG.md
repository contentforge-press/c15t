## @c15t/integrations@3.0.0-alpha.3 (alpha)

### Ship a c15t skill and the v3 guides in every package

Each package now ships a `SKILL.md` next to `AGENTS.md`, telling coding agents
how to pick a setup, which rules to follow and how to verify consent, with
links into the bundled Markdown. `@c15t/core`, `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`,
`@c15t/scripts`, `@c15t/browser`, `@c15t/integrations` and `@c15t/cli` publish
it for the first time.

The bundled docs follow the rewritten v3 guides: concept pages, a setup
chooser, a full page set for every framework, and a new HTML guide for the
script tag in `@c15t/browser`. `@c15t/iab` points its homepage and README at
the new IAB page.

### Fix consent handling, IDs and loader URLs in vendor helpers

Amplitude now queues `setOptOut(false)` when it loads with measurement consent, so an opt-out Amplitude saved in its cookie after an earlier revocation no longer keeps tracking off. The Amplitude script now stays on the page after revocation (`persistAfterConsentRevoked: true`) and a later grant calls `setOptOut(false)` on the running SDK instead of loading the bundle a second time.

Heap keeps the methods of a running heap.js when measurement consent is granted again without a page reload, instead of replacing them with queue stubs.

Matomo with `defaultConsent: 'given'` queues `setConsentGiven` and the initial page view only when the visitor has measurement consent as the script loads, and queues `requireConsent` otherwise. Vendor helpers now run their consent-granted and consent-denied steps only when that vendor's consent changes, so a change to an unrelated category no longer queues another Matomo page view.

Umami receives an array of `domains` as the comma-separated `data-domains` list its tracker reads, instead of a JSON array.

`xPixelEvent`, `metaPixelEvent`, `metaPixelCustomEvent`, `metaPixelSingleEvent` and `metaPixelSingleCustomEvent` now do nothing when the pixel global is missing, like the other event helpers. `xPixelEvent` no longer throws before marketing consent.

The TikTok Pixel records the pixel in `ttq._i`, `ttq._t` and `ttq._o` the way `ttq.load()` does in TikTok's base code, and grants TikTok consent once instead of twice.

Helpers with a required ID now throw `<helper>: missing or invalid <option>` when the ID is empty or only whitespace: `metaPixel`, `tiktokPixel`, `snapchatPixel`, `pinterestTag`, `redditPixel`, `xPixel`, `linkedinInsights`, `microsoftUet`, `openaiPixel`, `googleTagManager`, `gtag`, `posthog`, `databuddy`, `fathomAnalytics`, `crisp` and `intercom`. These IDs are also trimmed. An empty or whitespace-only `scriptUrl` or `scriptSrc` now counts as unset and uses the vendor's default loader.

Crisp keeps a `window.$crisp` queue the page filled before the helper ran.

`cloudflareZaraz` now sets `vendor: 'cloudflare-zaraz'`, so visitors can turn it off like other vendors. While it is off, every Zaraz purpose mapped to an optional category is denied.

### Rename the vendor integrations package

Replace `@c15t/scripts` with `@c15t/integrations` in v3 dependencies and imports.
Vendor subpaths, helper names, and the `scripts` configuration option stay the
same. `@c15t/scripts` remains available as a deprecated compatibility package
throughout v3, re-exporting the same implementation and types. Compatibility
ends in v4; previously published versions remain available on npm.

The CLI installs and imports `@c15t/integrations` in generated applications.
Run `c15t codemods scripts-to-integrations --dry-run --json` to preview import
changes in JavaScript and TypeScript files, then repeat without `--dry-run` to
apply them. Update package dependencies and Vue or Svelte component imports
separately.
