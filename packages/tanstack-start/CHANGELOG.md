## @c15t/tanstack-start@3.0.0-alpha.4 (alpha)

### Resolve a relative backendURL against the request, not forwarding headers

A relative `backendURL` or `manifestURL` no longer resolves against client-controlled forwarding headers. The server helpers previously built the backend origin from `x-forwarded-host`, `x-forwarded-proto` or `referer` when present, so a request that set them could make the server send its `/init` or manifest request, with the request's cookies and forwarded headers, to another host.

A relative URL now resolves against the URL the framework resolved the request under (`event.url` in SvelteKit, `request.url` in Next.js route handlers, TanStack Start and Astro), or against the `host` header where no request URL exists (Next.js `resolveConsent`, `fetchSSRData`). A bare `host` resolves over `https` for a domain name and over `http` for `localhost`, an IP address, or a single-label host such as `app:3000`. The `referer` header is no longer used.

Apps behind a proxy that sets forwarding headers and drops incoming ones can opt back in with `trustForwardedHeaders: true` on SvelteKit `loadConsent` and `resolveConsent`, Next.js `resolveConsent`, `createNextConsentRouteHandlers` and `createPagesApiHandlers`, and `@c15t/react/server` `fetchSSRData` and `normalizeBackendURL`, matching the existing TanStack Start option. The rule lives in `resolveRequestBackendURL` and `resolveRequestOrigin`, new exports of `@c15t/core/server`, which every server adapter now shares. With the option set, the forwarded host and the forwarded scheme apply independently, so a proxy that keeps `host` and only sets `x-forwarded-proto` or `x-forwarded-ssl` still decides the scheme.

The SvelteKit and `@c15t/react/server` helpers also stop passing the client's `forwarded`, `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers to the backend, including when `forwardHeaders` names them in SvelteKit. `extractRelevantHeaders` in both packages leaves them out unless called with `{ trustForwardedHeaders: true }`. `fetchSSRData` still makes its `/init` request when those headers are the only ones besides `host`; it just does not forward them.

`resolveBackendURL` from `@c15t/schema/types` is deprecated in favor of `resolveRequestBackendURL`. It now follows the same rule by default: it reads only the `host` header, and ignores `x-forwarded-*` and `referer` unless its new third argument is `{ trustForwardedHeaders: true }`, which restores the previous resolution order. The forwarded values are now validated like `host`: the first entry of a comma-separated list is used, a scheme other than `http` or `https` is ignored, and a host that is not a bare authority resolves to `null`.

### Require a TanStack Start release with the server-function XSS fix

The `@tanstack/react-start` peer range now starts at 1.168.60, and `@tanstack/react-router` at 1.170.41, the release Start 1.168.60 pins. Earlier Start releases from 1.143.12 are affected by CVE-2026-102989, a reflected XSS in server-function responses (GHSA-qx66-fv34-fjm8). Package managers now warn when an app installs `@c15t/tanstack-start` next to an affected Start release. Upgrade both packages together.

### Forward consent saves through the SvelteKit consent route

`createSvelteKitConsentRouteHandlers` answered `GET` only, so a provider
using `hosted({ url: '/api/c15t' })` got `405` on every save. Pass
`proxy: true` and the handlers add `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and
`OPTIONS`, which forward to `backendURL`. `GET` forwards paths other than
`init` and `manifest`, which are still resolved in-process. Only those
exact rest paths stay local, so a `paths` entry such as `reports/manifest`
is forwarded. Export all six from the catch-all route:

```ts
// src/routes/api/c15t/[...path]/+server.ts
export const { GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS } =
	createSvelteKitConsentRouteHandlers({ backendURL, proxy: true });
```

The option and its rules match `createConsentServerRoute({ proxy })` in
`@c15t/tanstack-start`: only `subjects`, `subjects/:id`, `init`,
`manifest`, `health`, `status` and any `paths` you add are forwarded, and
anything else gets `404`. Cookies are forwarded only when `cookieNames`
names them. The client address comes from `event.getClientAddress()`, and
`x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` from `event.url`.

A relative `backendURL` or `manifestURL`, such as `/api/self-host`, is now
fetched through `event.fetch`, so SvelteKit answers it in-process. The
route handlers used to resolve it against `event.url`, which on
adapter-node without `ORIGIN` takes its host from the client's `Host`
header, so a forged header could send the manifest, init or proxied
request to a host of the client's choosing and return its response. The
`fetch` option now applies to absolute URLs only.

To a remote backend over plain `http:`, the proxy sends only the public
browser headers: no cookies, no custom headers and no `x-forwarded-for`.
Such a backend no longer sees the visitor's IP address, so it cannot use it
for geolocation or rate limiting; use an `https:` backend URL to keep it.
Loopback `http:` backends still receive all three.

The proxy rules now live in `@c15t/core/server` as `forwardConsentRequest`,
`resolveConsentProxyOptions`, `isConsentProxyPathAllowed` and related
helpers, and both adapters use them. Each adapter supplies only what its
framework can trust for the forwarding headers. Both proxies now answer
`504` with a JSON body when the backend misses the deadline and `502` when
it cannot be reached, instead of a framework error page. They also stop
passing `TE`, `Trailer` and any header the backend's `Connection` value
names on to the browser. TanStack Start's proxy otherwise behaves as
before.

### Count each experiment arm's visitors through `/init`

The backend now learns which arm a visitor runs before they choose, so a dashboard can compute an opt-in rate per arm without any analytics setup. While a visitor has no stored choice, `/init` carries their arm in an `x-c15t-experiment: <id>=<arm>` header, and the backend adds `experiment: { id, arm }` to that request's session report. Manifest-mode renders and init routes put it on the report they send to `POST /sessions`. A visitor who already chose is not counted, because they are not shown the banner.

On a server-rendered page, pass the experiment with the visitor's arm to `resolveConsent({ experiment: { ...bannerShape, arm } })` in `c15t/next`, `@c15t/tanstack-start` and `@c15t/svelte`. The server sends only `{ id, arm }` to the backend, and the returned state carries the experiment to the client, so the provider needs no `experiment` option of its own. A streamed (unawaited) state arrives after the provider mounts, so pass the experiment to the client too; the provider warns in development when you forget. Astro and Nuxt send the arm they rendered on their own. `@c15t/schema` exports `CONSENT_EXPERIMENT_HEADER`, `formatExperimentHeader` and `parseExperimentHeader`, and the session report schema gains an optional `experiment`.

The `choice:recorded` kernel event and `onChoiceRecorded` payload now include `uiSource` and `consentAction`, and `onSurfaceShown` and `onChoiceRecorded` carry the arm, so forwarding experiment events to GTM, PostHog or any other tool is one callback.

Opt-out experiments are measurable too. The `notice:dismissed` kernel event now carries `surface`, `timeToDecisionMs` and `experiment`. The surface is the snapshot's `activeUI`, so a programmatic `dismissNotice()` with no prompt open reports `surface: 'none'` and no timing, the same as a programmatic `save()`.

Dev-tools show the assigned experiment arm and the first impression time of each surface on the Policy tab.

### Load the Tailwind 3 PostCSS plugin from the package you installed

Every package that publishes a c15t stylesheet now exports the Tailwind 3 PostCSS plugin as `<package>/postcss-tailwind3`, so you no longer install `@c15t/ui` just to list it:

- `c15t/postcss-tailwind3` for apps that install `c15t` (React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt and Astro)
- `@c15t/svelte/postcss-tailwind3` for Svelte and SvelteKit
- `@c15t/browser/postcss-tailwind3` for script tag pages that style the light DOM
- `@c15t/react/postcss-tailwind3`, `@c15t/nextjs/postcss-tailwind3`, `@c15t/tanstack-start/postcss-tailwind3`, `@c15t/vue/postcss-tailwind3` and `@c15t/astro/postcss-tailwind3` for apps that install an adapter directly

```js title="postcss.config.mjs"
export default {
	plugins: {
		'c15t/postcss-tailwind3': {},
		tailwindcss: {},
		autoprefixer: {},
	},
};
```

Each one re-exports `@c15t/ui/postcss-tailwind3`, so configs that already list that name keep working. The plugin must still come before `tailwindcss`.

`c15t setup` now adds the plugin from the package it installs, `c15t/postcss-tailwind3`, or `@c15t/react/postcss-tailwind3` and `@c15t/nextjs/postcss-tailwind3` in apps that installed those directly, and no longer installs `@c15t/ui` for Tailwind 3. It leaves a config alone when any c15t `postcss-tailwind3` entry, including `@c15t/ui/postcss-tailwind3`, already runs before `tailwindcss`.

### Rename the remaining `frame` names to `consentGate`

**Breaking.** `ConsentGate` was called `Frame`, and several names still said so. They now say `consentGate`:

- The translations section `frame` is now `consentGate` (`consentGate.title`, `consentGate.actionButton`, `consentGate.policyBlocked`, `consentGate.loading` and `consentGate.error`) in every bundled language, in `CompleteTranslations` and `Translations`, in the `/init` response schema, in `@c15t/backend` responses and in the React Native translation types. `FrameTranslations` is now `ConsentGateTranslations`, and the old name stays as a deprecated alias.
- The stylesheet `@c15t/ui/styles/components/frame` is now `@c15t/ui/styles/components/consent-gate`, and its custom properties are `--consent-gate-*` instead of `--frame-*`.
- The placeholder's test ids are `consent-gate-placeholder` and `consent-gate-button` instead of `frame-placeholder` and `frame-open-dialog`. Its title now has `consent-gate-title`.

Copy under the old key still works. When custom translations, `i18n.messages`, stored copy or an older backend's `/init` response has `frame`, c15t reads it as `consentGate`, with `consentGate` winning key by key when both are set, and logs a warning once outside production. `@c15t/translations` exports the conversion as `migrateLegacyTranslationKeys`. The `frame` stylesheet subpaths stay as deprecated aliases of `consent-gate` for this alpha.

`theme.slots` has a `consentGate` family for the placeholder: `consentGate` for the card, `consentGateTitle` and `consentGateButton`. React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue and Svelte apply them. React and Vue also take the same parts as `components['consent-gate'].root`, `.title` and `.button`, and `components` wins where both set an attribute. `consentGateButton` applies on top of `buttonPrimary`.

### Load new copy from `useSetLanguage()` and fix composed banner parts

`useSetLanguage()` now runs init again after storing the language, so the banner and dialog switch to that language without a separate `init()` call. Setting the current language does nothing, and a disabled provider stores the language without running init. With a `runtime` passed to `ConsentProvider`, the runtime reinitializes itself.

The React `offline()` mode, also exported by `@c15t/nextjs` and `@c15t/tanstack-start`, is now core's `offline()`. A language from `useSetLanguage()` or `overrides.language` switches the copy when the bundled translations or `i18n.messages` have that language, and a language with no copy keeps the default copy. The language a server prefetch detected from `Accept-Language` still does not switch the copy, including when `prefetch` is a pending promise.

`ConsentProvider` logs a development warning when `options.callbacks` is passed together with `runtime`. The runtime runs the callbacks its owner passed to `createConsentRuntime({ callbacks })`, and the provider's own callbacks were dropped without notice. The options type for a borrowed runtime now rejects `callbacks`.

Composed banner parts:

- `ConsentBanner.Card` fills a callback ref and keeps its focus trap. Before, a callback ref replaced the ref the trap read, so a blocking card did not trap focus.
- `ConsentBanner.Title` and `ConsentDialog.HeaderTitle` with `asChild` render the child element, such as an `h1`, in place of the `h2`. Before, the child was nested inside the `h2`. `ConsentBanner.Overlay` now honors `asChild` too. `ConsentBanner.Description` and `ConsentDialog.HeaderDescription` with `asChild` and no child element render their default markup instead of nothing.
- `ConsentBanner.AcceptButton`, `RejectButton` and `CustomizeButton` placed by hand now carry `data-action="accept"`, `"reject"` and `"customize"`, as they do in the stock banner, and pick up `theme.consentActions.accept`, `.reject` and `.customize`. An explicit `data-action` or `consentAction` prop still wins.

### Pass the backend URL to the server helpers

**Breaking.** The server helpers no longer read c15t configuration from environment variables. Pass `backendURL` or `manifestURL` to them. If you keep the URL in an environment variable, read it in your own code and pass the value.

| Helper | No longer read |
| --- | --- |
| `createNextConsentRouteHandlers`, `createPagesApiHandlers` (`c15t/next/api`, `c15t/next/pages`) | `C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `C15T_MANIFEST_URL`, `C15T_MANIFEST_REVALIDATE_SECONDS` |
| `createConsentServerRoute` (`c15t/tanstack-start/api`) | `C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `VITE_C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `C15T_MANIFEST_URL` |
| `createSvelteKitConsentRouteHandlers` (`@c15t/svelte/kit`) | `C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `C15T_MANIFEST_URL` |
| `manifest()` mode and its injected routes (`c15t/astro`) | `C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `PUBLIC_C15T_BACKEND_URL`, `C15T_MANIFEST_URL` |

These helpers now take a required options argument. Without `backendURL` or `manifestURL`, each request throws, for example `@c15t/nextjs/api: pass backendURL or manifestURL.` Astro's `manifest()` without a `backendURL` or an inline `manifest` fails when `astro.config` loads. `manifestRevalidateSeconds` defaults to `300`.

The ready-made handlers built from environment variables are removed: `GET` and `manifestGET` from `c15t/next/api` and `@c15t/nextjs/api`, and `GET`, `manifestGET` and `initGET` from `c15t/tanstack-start/api` and `@c15t/tanstack-start/api`.

Before:

```ts title="app/api/c15t/manifest/route.ts"
export { manifestGET as GET } from 'c15t/next/api';
```

After:

```ts title="app/api/c15t/manifest/route.ts"
import { createNextConsentRouteHandlers } from 'c15t/next/api';

import { consentConfig } from '@/c15t.config';

export const { manifestGET: GET } =
	createNextConsentRouteHandlers(consentConfig);
```

The init route takes `GET` from the same call. You can pass options instead of a config, for example `createNextConsentRouteHandlers({ backendURL: 'https://your-project.inth.app' })`.

`c15t setup` writes the chosen backend URL into the generated components, `c15t.config.ts` and the `next.config` rewrite as a string. Quotes and backslashes in the URL are escaped, so they no longer break the generated `next.config`. It no longer writes `.env.local` or `.env.example`, no longer asks whether to store the URL in a `.env` file, and no longer accepts `--env`.

### Load only the dialog link from its subpath

`@c15t/nextjs/components/consent-dialog-link`, `@c15t/tanstack-start/components/consent-dialog-link` and their `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` equivalents now export only `ConsentDialogLink`. They pointed at the whole adapter entry, so importing the link pulled in the rest of the adapter.

### Resolve unknown locations on static pages with the manifest's own policy

`createStaticConsentResolver` from `@c15t/tanstack-start/static` now starts a visitor with no known location on the manifest's unknown-location policy (its `fallback` pack, else its `default` pack), as `@c15t/nextjs/static` already did and as server rendering does when location headers are missing. It previously picked the strictest pack in the manifest and applied it to everyone, including packs scoped to other countries. A manifest with no fallback or default pack now resolves to a failed `insufficient-inputs` result, and the client applies its safe fallback.

Geo data that isn't a non-empty string, such as a numeric `country` or a blank `regionCode` from the geo endpoint, now counts as an unknown location. It previously reached the policy resolver and could end up in `location.countryCode`. String values are trimmed.

The static resolver now lives in `@c15t/core/static` (also available as `c15t/static`), and both framework `static` entries re-export it. `resolveStrictestDefaultInit` is renamed to `resolveUnknownLocationInit`. The old name still works in `@c15t/nextjs/static` and `@c15t/tanstack-start/static` and is marked deprecated.

### Ship a c15t skill and the v3 guides in every package

Each package now ships a `SKILL.md` next to `AGENTS.md`, telling coding agents
how to pick a setup, which rules to follow and how to verify consent, with
links into the bundled Markdown. `@c15t/core`, `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`,
`@c15t/scripts`, `@c15t/browser`, `@c15t/integrations` and `@c15t/cli` publish
it for the first time.

The bundled docs follow the rewritten v3 guides: concept pages, a setup
chooser, a full page set for every framework, and a new HTML guide for the
script tag in `@c15t/browser`. `@c15t/iab` points its homepage and README at
the new IAB page.

## @c15t/tanstack-start@3.0.0-alpha.3 (alpha)

### Encode and enforce IAB publisher restrictions

Configure TCF publisher restrictions with `publisherRestrictions` on `createIAB`, `IABProvider`, the runtime's `iab` options or the Astro integration's `iab` options. c15t writes them into the TC string's `PubRestrictions` section, decodes them from stored strings, and reports them through `__tcfapi('getTCData')` as `publisher.restrictions`. Previously that map was always empty and configured restrictions were not encoded.

Consent-gated scripts, network rules and iframes with a `vendorId` now apply the confirmed restrictions: type 0 blocks the purpose, type 1 requires consent and type 2 requires legitimate interest for purposes the vendor list marks as flexible. Accept all grants the vendor signal a restriction needs. Legitimate interest a restriction introduces applies until the visitor objects, so Save Settings encodes it as allowed, matching what the preference centres show.

The React, Vue, Svelte and `@c15t/browser/iab` preference centres list each vendor under the legal basis the restrictions leave it, so a vendor moved to legitimate interest gets an objection control instead of a consent toggle. A purpose whose vendors all use legitimate interest shows no consent switch, only the objection, and display-model rows report this as `hasConsentBasis`. Such a purpose no longer decides its c15t category, so a granular save no longer records a denial that blocks its legitimate-interest vendors; legitimate interest never grants a category on its own. Custom UIs can use `applyPublisherRestrictionsToGVL` from `@c15t/iab/headless` or pass `publisherRestrictions` to `processGVLForDialog`.

IAB gates no longer let a refused c15t category block a target that uses only legitimate interest after publisher restrictions. Such a target needs no consent under TCF, so its purpose and vendor legitimate interest signals, and the visitor's objection, decide. Previously every restriction on a referenced category blocked IAB targets; GPC, opt-out directives and strict scope still do, and the refused category still blocks scripts that name only the category or declare a consent purpose.

Unsupported restrictions throw `PublisherRestrictionError` instead of being dropped. This covers reserved type 3, vendors or purposes missing from the vendor list, legitimate interest for purposes 1 and 3 to 6, basis changes on purposes the vendor does not declare as flexible, conflicting types for one vendor, and restrictions in a string that is not service-specific. `whenReady()`, `save()` and `generateTCString()` reject, and no TC string is written. Retrying `whenReady()` does not fetch another vendor list. With an explicit `gvl`, the error lasts for the handle and saving keeps failing even if the kernel later holds a different list; a CMP following the kernel's list checks a replacement list again. When a replacement vendor list makes a restriction unsupported, the TC authority confirmed under the previous list is cleared. Whenever the CMP withdraws its own authority, including on expiry, it also removes the `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry. A stored TC string whose restrictions differ from the configuration is not restored; the banner opens again for a returning visitor and closes once they save, IAB gates stay denied until then, and the superseded `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry are removed. Decoding a string written under TCF policy version 2 or 3 accepts legitimate interest required for purposes 3 to 6, which those versions allowed.

### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change, and so does every tab when localStorage is unavailable and only the
cookie is stored. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared. When two
tabs act in the same millisecond, the record stored first wins in both. A
tab that opened before another stored a subject joins the stored subject
unless it identified a different user; a subject id the server resolved is
kept unless a strictly newer stored choice carries another one. Only a
record this tab saw in storage is cleared when it disappears, so a choice
seeded while storage was blocked survives storage becoming readable.

Under an IAB policy, `@c15t/iab` loads the TC string another tab stored once
its choice is reconciled, with its purpose, vendor and special-feature
selections, so `__tcfapi` and the preference controls no longer show the
previous choice. Selections changed in this tab without saving are kept. A
TC string that grants any purpose of a category denied after it was saved
is withdrawn and not restored on the next page load; a partial purpose
selection saved through IAB keeps its TC string. A TC string confirmed before
the reconciled choice's newest decision, such as after a save on a sibling
subdomain that shares the consent cookie, is withdrawn as well, since the TC
string and its receipt belong to one origin. A newer receipt replaces the held
one even when the TC string is identical.

Clearing records now stores the clear epoch, the time of the clear, under
`c15t-epoch` in localStorage and a cookie of the same name, and clearing never
removes it. Every consent record written afterwards records its epoch too.
Decisions confirmed before the epoch are void everywhere: a tab that reconciles
after another tab cleared and saved again drops its pre-clear decisions, a tab
that missed the clear cannot write them back, and browser hydration and server
reads (`readStoredRecordsFromCookieHeader`) ignore them. A decision in the
clearing millisecond counts only from a tab that had seen the clear. Each clear
moves the epoch forward even after the clock went back, and an epoch up to an
hour ahead of the clock is kept. Records from before any clear, including v2
and legacy records, read as epoch 0 and are unaffected; a corrupt epoch also
reads as 0, and a record whose epoch field is corrupt is kept.

The consent cookie stays authoritative, but a denial in its localStorage copy
that is newer than the cookie's decision is now applied on top of it, so a
dropped cookie write no longer keeps an older grant in force. Copies written
under different clear epochs are cut to the later epoch first, and the
subject comes from the later copy. Privacy directives from both copies of the
privacy record apply, a newer local vendor list adds denials without lifting
any (a vendor copy from before the last clear is ignored), and the newer notice
dismissal applies. A newer local
grant is still not applied.

This changes the stored format: after a clear, the consent cookie gains
`&e=<time>` (16 bytes) and the localStorage record an `epoch` field (22 bytes).
Visitors who never cleared store what they did before. Older c15t builds reject
both the cookie and the localStorage record once they carry the epoch and treat
the visitor as undecided, so under an opt-out policy they grant optional
categories by default until a new choice is saved. Deploy the new build to every
page of the site before visitors can clear their records.

When two tabs write at the same moment and one write drops the other tab's
category or directive, the tab that lost it writes it back on its next
reconciliation, including directives it kept from storage in its own write.
Under an IAB policy, a TC string that grants a category a
reconciled denial covers is withdrawn before any `__tcfapi` listener is
notified, and one that predates another tab's newer choice is held back until
this tab reads that tab's receipt, so a revoked vendor is never advertised
again. A tab reloads the TC string when another tab stores a new receipt, which
covers a save in the same millisecond or one that changed only vendors, and
stops publishing the held one until the reload decides. Two receipts from the
same millisecond settle on the more restrictive one, so a revoked vendor is
never advertised again; when each grants something the other denies, the
stored receipt is removed and neither is published until the next save. When
another tab removes the receipt or clears localStorage, the held TC string is
withdrawn, and a receipt still being decoded is not installed. localStorage
has no conditional removal, so the removal after a tie can still delete a
receipt another tab stored a moment earlier; every tab then withholds its TC
string until the next save.

A page seeded from a server's cookie read applies newer denials and privacy
directives that reached only localStorage, and a local denial from the same
millisecond as a seeded grant, and a clear after the clock went
back more than an hour writes an epoch other tabs can still read. That capped
epoch cannot void decisions dated after it that a runtime which missed the
clear writes back; times alone cannot order a clear against a clock that went
back more than an hour. When the cookie and its localStorage copy hold
conflicting decisions from the same millisecond, the denial wins. The
subject comes from the cookie, which a server-side restoration or a sibling
subdomain can rewrite on its own, unless this browser's last write reached
only localStorage and the cookie has not changed since; such a write leaves a
`<storageKey>-cookie-miss` marker in localStorage. A localStorage write that
fails while the cookie write lands removes the older local copy.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.

See [keep open tabs in step](https://c15t.com/docs/guides/consent-state#keep-open-tabs-in-step).

### Render theme CSS on the server

**Breaking.** The browser no longer generates theme CSS. `ConsentProvider` (and `ConsentRoot`) used to turn `options.theme` tokens into a `<style id="c15t-theme">` element on every page, so every visitor downloaded the theme generator and the default theme, about 1.7 KB gzip. The package stylesheet already carries the default tokens, so the provider now renders no theme style at all.

Render custom tokens with the new `ConsentTheme` component, exported from `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`, `@c15t/tanstack-start` and the `c15t/react`, `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` entries. It is not a client component: render it from a Server Component and the generator stays on the server. `ConsentTheme` takes `theme`, `colorScheme` (`'light'`, `'dark'` or `'system'`, applied before hydration) and `nonce`. `generateThemeCSS()` from `@c15t/ui/theme` now escapes `<`, so its output is safe inside a `<style>` element wherever you render it.

`@c15t/svelte`'s provider no longer injects the token CSS after hydration, which also removes the one-frame flash of default colors in SvelteKit. `@c15t/astro` now renders the integration's `theme` tokens on the server, next to the config script, instead of leaving them to the dialog islands.

### Migration

- **Next.js App Router.** Move the theme to a module without `'use client'`. Render `<ConsentTheme theme={theme} />` in the root layout (a Server Component) next to your consent wrapper, and pass `colorScheme` and `nonce` there if you set them on `ConsentRoot`. Keep `options.theme` on `ConsentRoot` only for `consentActions` and slot styles.
- **Next.js Pages Router.** Render `ConsentTheme` in `pages/_document.tsx`.
- **TanStack Start.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from a `createServerFn` handler in the root loader and render it in a `<style id="c15t-theme">` in the head. Rendering `ConsentTheme` in the root component also works but ships the generator.
- **React without server rendering.** Render `ConsentTheme` next to the provider (this ships the generator), or put the output of `generateThemeCSS(theme)` in your stylesheet.
- **SvelteKit.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from `+layout.server.ts` and render it inside `<svelte:head>`. Keep slot styles and `consentActions` in `options.theme`.
- **Astro.** Keep tokens in the integration's `theme`. Tokens in the client entrypoint's `theme` are no longer applied.
- **Light and dark at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` without `colorScheme` and toggle the `dark` class on `<html>` (for example with next-themes): its output holds both schemes. The provider's `colorScheme` option still keeps the `c15t-dark` class in sync after hydration.
- **Switching token sets at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` from a client component and change its props.
- Keep importing the package stylesheet. It holds the default tokens the provider used to inject.

In development, the provider warns when `theme` holds tokens but the page has no `c15t-theme` stylesheet.

### Stream the page while consent resolves in TanStack Start

`ConsentRoot`'s `state` now accepts a pending promise, so the root loader can return the consent server function call without awaiting it: `loader: () => ({ consent: getConsentState() })`. TanStack Router streams the promise and the response starts without waiting for the consent backend. The awaited loader holds the whole response until the manifest arrives, which costs the backend's latency on a cold manifest cache and up to the manifest cache's request timeout when the backend stops answering.

With the streamed loader the banner mounts after hydration instead of arriving in the server HTML. No optional category is granted until the state resolves, so gated scripts and embeds stay blocked. The awaited loader keeps working and stays the quickstart default; the quickstart's new "Stream the page while consent resolves" section compares the two.

### Keep dialog CSS out of the render-blocking stylesheet

**Breaking.** `styles.css` now carries only what a first paint can show: the default tokens, every c15t CSS variable, and the rules for the banner, `ConsentDialogTrigger` and the `ConsentGate` placeholder. It shrinks from 125 KB to 66 KB (16.2 KB to 8.8 KB gzipped). The dialog and preference-widget rules moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`, which the dialog's module imports, so your bundler ships them with the dialog's lazy chunk and applies them before the dialog renders. In a Next.js production build the page's stylesheet drops from 18.2 KB to 10.6 KB gzipped.

- `@c15t/ui/styles.css` and `styles.tw3.css` no longer contain the dialog, preference widget, accordion, switch, tabs, collapsible, preference item or vendor list rules. React, Next.js and TanStack Start load them for you. If you render `@c15t/ui` class maps for those parts in your own components, import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`.
- `@c15t/react/primitives` and every `@c15t/react/primitives/*` entry load the dialog stylesheet, because the accordion, collapsible, preference item, switch and tabs rules moved there.
- JavaScript loads the dialog rules through the new `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog` module. Bundlers follow its import of `styles/dialog.css`; under the `node` export condition it imports nothing, so plain Node (the Pages Router, or SSR that keeps dependencies external) can load every `@c15t/react` entry. Import it instead of the `.css` file from components that can run on the server.
- The rules for the `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives` class maps moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives.css`. The React components never used them. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` imports them; other hosts that render those class maps import the file themselves.
- `iab/styles.css` no longer repeats the default tokens and the shared rules. Import it after `styles.css`, as the IAB guides already say.
- Tailwind 3: the dialog stylesheet goes through your PostCSS pipeline, and Tailwind 3 rejects its `@layer components` block. Add `@c15t/ui/postcss-tailwind3` before `tailwindcss` in your PostCSS plugins. Without it the build fails with "`@layer components` is used but no matching `@tailwind components` directive is present".
- If you import `styles.css` into a named layer (`@import '…/styles.css' layer(c15t)`), the dialog rules still join the top-level `components` layer.

Svelte, Astro, Vue and the script-tag build render the same styles as before. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` still holds every rule, because Svelte loads its dialog with the page. Astro injects the banner rules; the React and Svelte dialog islands import the rest, which Astro links on every page, and with `ui: 'vue'` the integration injects them. If you set `styles: false` with `ui: 'vue'`, also import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`. `@c15t/browser` inlines the dialog rules as before.

### Load offline mode on demand in ConsentRoot

`ConsentRoot` in `@c15t/nextjs` and `@c15t/tanstack-start` picks its transport at runtime and imported `offline()` statically, so every app that rendered it shipped offline mode's recommended policy-rule pack in its initial client JavaScript, even with a backend URL, where offline mode never runs. `ConsentRoot` now loads offline mode on first init, and only when no backend URL is set. In production builds of each quickstart's setup, initial JavaScript drops by 8,949 bytes (3,560 bytes gzip) on Next.js 16 and by 28,396 bytes (9,759 bytes gzip) on TanStack Start. A root without a backend still resolves the recommended rules, after loading one extra chunk.

### `ConsentGate` mounts a granted embed after hydration

**Breaking.** With the App Router's awaited `resolveConsent` layout, a returning visitor
who had allowed the category downloaded a `ConsentGate` iframe twice. The
page streams inside a `Suspense` boundary, and React moves that HTML into
place after the browser has parsed it. The browser starts loading the
iframe during parsing and loads it again after the move.

`ConsentGate` no longer puts granted children in the server HTML. A denied
category still gets the placeholder there. A granted category gets the empty
wrapper, and its children mount once hydration completes, so the iframe loads
once in every layout. Client-side renders mount the children at once, as
before.

### Migration

- Server HTML for a granted `ConsentGate` no longer contains its children.
  Tests or crawlers that read the embed from the server response need to wait
  for hydration.
- Size the wrapper with `className` or `style` so the page keeps the embed's
  space while it mounts.

### Server rendering no longer waits on a slow or failing consent backend

`resolveConsent` in Next.js and TanStack Start, and server rendering in Nuxt, now wait at most `timeoutMs` (500 ms by default) for the visitor's policy. Before, a backend that never answered held an awaited layout blank for the manifest cache's 10 second timeout. When the budget runs out, the page renders without consent UI in the server HTML, optional categories stay denied and consent-gated scripts and iframes stay blocked. The browser then resolves the policy and shows the banner once the backend answers. The manifest request keeps running and fills the cache for the next request.

The server manifest cache now remembers a failed request when nothing usable is cached. It waits 1 second before asking the backend again, doubling up to 5 seconds while failures continue; requests in between fail at once with a `ManifestUnavailableError`. Before, every request after a cold failure went to the backend. Concurrent requests still share one upstream request, and a stale copy is still served only inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window. The upstream request timeout drops from 10 to 5 seconds.

Next.js `resolveConsent` reads the manifest through the in-process cache whatever `manifestURL` points at. A warm render no longer makes a request to your own manifest route, and a `manifestURL` pointing at the backend no longer fetches it on every render.

The Nuxt init route no longer falls back to the backend's `/init` for every request while the manifest is backing off. It still falls back when the backend has no `/manifest` endpoint.

### Migration

- Pages whose backend takes longer than 500 ms on a cold cache now render the banner after hydration on that request instead of in the server HTML. Raise `timeoutMs`, or set `timeoutMs: false` to wait as before, up to the new 5 second request timeout.
- Pass `waitUntil` to Next.js `resolveConsent`, or `onBackgroundRevalidate` to TanStack Start `resolveConsent`, so serverless platforms keep a manifest request alive after the render stops waiting for it.
- Code that retried the manifest cache in a loop after a failure now receives `ManifestUnavailableError` with `reason: 'backoff'` until the retry floor passes. Its `retryAfterMs` says when the next attempt is allowed.
- Next.js `resolveConsent` now refuses to forward `forwardHeaders` credentials to a plain `http://` manifest URL on a host other than loopback, matching the route handlers; the render falls back to the baseline state and reports the error.

### Remove `useConsentManager()`

**Breaking.** `useConsentManager()` is no longer exported from `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`, `@c15t/tanstack-start`, their `/headless` entries, or the `c15t/react`, `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` umbrella entries. The undocumented `useConsentManagerDraft()` on `@c15t/react/draft` is gone with it. The hook subscribed to the whole consent snapshot, so each caller re-rendered on every change. Read each field through its own hook, which re-renders only when that value changes.

`useSubscribeToConsentChanges()` and `useRegisterConsentCategories()` are now exported from the main entries as well as `@c15t/react/hooks`.

| `useConsentManager()` field | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `activeUI`, `setActiveUI` | `useActiveUI()` (can be `null`), `useSetActiveUI()` |
| `has(category)` | `useConsent(category)` |
| `consents`, `effectivePermissions`, `explicitChoice` | `useConsents()`, `useEffectivePermissions()`, `useExplicitChoice()` |
| `promptRequirement`, `noticeDismissal`, `privacySignals`, `optOutDirectives`, `restrictions` | `usePromptRequirement()`, `useNoticeDismissal()`, `usePrivacySignals()`, `useOptOutDirectives()`, `useRestrictions()` |
| `resolution`, `policyRule`, `policyScopeMode` | `usePolicyResolution()`, `usePolicyRule()`, `usePolicyScopeMode()` |
| `policyCategories` | `usePolicyCategories()` (without the leading `'necessary'`) |
| `policyBanner`, `policyDialog` | `usePromptPresentation()`, `usePreferencesPresentation()` |
| `model`, `branding` | `useModel()`, `useBranding()` (both can be `null`) |
| `iab`, `vendors`, `vendorChoice` | `useIABSnapshot()`, `useDeclaredVendors()`, `useVendorChoice()` |
| `getDisplayedVendors(category)` | `useDeclaredVendors()` filtered by category |
| `subscribeToConsentChanges`, `updateConsentCategories` | `useSubscribeToConsentChanges()`, `useRegisterConsentCategories()` |
| `translationConfig` | `useTranslations()` |
| `selectedConsents`, `setSelectedConsent`, `selectedVendors`, `setSelectedVendor`, `resetDraft`, `draftIsStale` | `useConsentDraft()`: `values`, `set`, `vendors`, `setVendor`, `reset`, `isStale` |
| `consentCategories`, `consentTypes`, `getDisplayedConsents()` | `useConsentDraft().displayedCategories` with `useTranslations().consentTypes` |
| `saveConsents('all' \| 'necessary' \| 'custom')` | `useHeadlessConsentUI().performAction('accept' \| 'reject' \| 'save')` |
| `manager` | Nothing; it was always `null` |

Render components that stage choices with `useConsentDraft()` and save them with `useHeadlessConsentUI()` inside one `ConsentDraftProvider`, so both use the same draft.

`c15t codemods use-consent-manager-to-hooks` rewrites common destructuring forms. Fields it cannot rewrite stay on a `useConsentManager()` call under a `TODO(c15t v3)` comment naming the replacement.

The stock dialog, preference rows, vendor lists, dialog trigger and `ConsentGate` now read only the values they render. Toggling one category in the preferences dialog re-renders that category's row instead of every row.

### Fix declaration imports for Node16 and NodeNext

Fix declaration imports for TypeScript consumers using Node16 or NodeNext resolution. Preserve explicit JavaScript filenames so exported APIs retain their types without requiring `skipLibCheck`.

### Session reports from manifest mode

A host that resolves init from a cached manifest never calls `/init`, so the backend could not count the visitors it served. Every server-side resolution now sends `POST /sessions` to the backend after the fact, server-to-server and detached from the response: the Next.js, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Nuxt and Astro init routes, and the Next.js, TanStack Start and Astro render-time prefetches. The report carries the manifest revision, the matched policy, the jurisdiction, country, region, language and GPC signal. The visitor's user agent travels as `User-Agent` and the visitor's single client address on a dedicated `X-C15T-Client-IP` header, which the backend masks and records under its `ipAddress` settings; the forwarding chain itself is not sent, and neither are cookies. The browser makes no request.

`@c15t/backend` adds the `POST /sessions` route and a `sessions.onReport` option. Reports are written to the request's wide event and handed to the sink; nothing is stored. The backend's own `/init` emits the same event, so one sink sees hosted and manifest traffic alike.

Reports are handed to the same `onBackgroundRevalidate` hook as a background manifest refresh, so a host that already passes `after` or a platform `waitUntil` needs no change. `resolveConsent` in `@c15t/nextjs/server` gains `waitUntil` for the App Router. Set `reportSessions: false` on any adapter to send none. `createManifestTransport` in `@c15t/core` gains a `report` option; `@c15t/schema` adds `consentSessionReportSchema` and `buildConsentSessionReport`.

### Rename `Frame` to `ConsentGate`

`Frame` is now `ConsentGate` in React, Next.js, TanStack Start and Svelte, and Vue's `ConsentFrame` is now `ConsentGate`. The compound parts follow: `ConsentGate.Root`, `ConsentGate.Title` and `ConsentGate.Button`, with `ConsentGateProps` and `ConsentGateCompoundComponent` types. New subpaths are `c15t/react/consent-gate`, `c15t/react/components/consent-gate` and `@c15t/vue/runtime/components/consent-gate.vue`, and Nuxt auto-registers `<ConsentGate>`.

The old names, subpaths and Nuxt component remain as deprecated aliases for the same component. Props, behavior, `frame.*` translation keys, `--frame-*` CSS custom properties and `data-testid="frame-placeholder"` are unchanged.

### Granular consent

Grant a category and still turn one vendor off, outside IAB TCF. Declare vendors with the `vendors` option or the backend manifest, then name them with `vendor` on scripts and network rules and `data-vendor` on iframes. A target loads when its category passes and its vendor is not off; `alwaysLoad` scripts see the result in their callbacks.

The preference centers in React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt and Svelte list each category's vendors with a switch per vendor. Switches edit the draft and record on Save, disable while the category is off, and clear on Accept all and Reject all. React adds `useVendorDraft`, `useVendorAllowed`, `useDeclaredVendors` and `useVendorChoice`; `useConsentDraft` gains `vendors` and `setVendor`; the Svelte manager state gains `selectedVendors` and `setSelectedVendor`.

Denials persist in a `<storageKey>-vendors` cookie and localStorage entry and reach the backend as `vendorChoice`. Migration `4-vendor-choice` adds the column, so run the migrator before deploying. A denial has no expiry and does not delete cookies the vendor already set.

Also fixed: the Vue preference center rendered its switches and category rows unstyled in Nuxt, and the Vue and Svelte category description colour differed from React's.

### Remove dialog scheduling delays and preserve IAB actions

Remove first-open scheduling delays from React's aggregate dialog, widget, and compound components while preserving server rendering and hydration. Keep children mounted when an external runtime provides IAB context, so loading the bridge cannot reset local drafts.

Remove the extra Suspense delay from Astro's React IAB dialog island.

Queue external-runtime IAB actions until the runtime publishes its handle, and reject pending saves with AbortError when the borrowing provider unmounts. Correct the React and Next.js peer dependency ranges to require React and React DOM 18 or newer, matching the APIs already used by v3. Upgrade both React packages before using v3 on an older installation.

# @c15t/tanstack-start

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- dd44a61: Add opt-in `clearOnRevocation` configuration to remove declared cookies, localStorage keys, and sessionStorage keys when their consent category is denied or revoked. Support exact names, prefix patterns, and cookie scopes while protecting c15t consent records.

### Patch Changes

- 46f45c4: Render theme CSS in the server HTML to prevent React and Next.js consent banners from flashing default styles before hydration. Preserve the stylesheet and CSP nonce through hydration, and escape theme values so HTML-like strings remain inside the stylesheet.

  Apply explicit dark mode and system color preferences before hydration while preserving client-side theme updates.

  Reduce the theme generator's initial JavaScript and generated CSS size without changing theme tokens or contrast colors.

## 3.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- 4460e3e: This v3 alpha is for internal use only. APIs are unstable, and breaking changes will occur between alpha releases.

  Introduce the c15t umbrella package, shared consent runtime and policy rules, rewritten backend, and new framework and script-tag integrations. Update the CLI, IAB support, DevTools, and shared styles for v3.

  Packages now ship ESM only. Keep related packages on compatible v3 alpha versions.

  Export `defineTheme` and the `Theme` type from the React, Next.js, TanStack Start, and Vue entries so themes can use the same imports as their framework integration.

  Restrict iframe-blocker URL activation to HTTP and HTTPS. Replace backtracking URL and theme parsing expressions, correct the PostHog hostname boundary, and fix CLI layout detection for nested route groups and locale directories.

  Serve a stale consent manifest from the server adapters' in-process cache inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window while one background request revalidates it, instead of blocking every request after `s-maxage` expires; a failed or timed-out revalidation keeps the stale manifest. The backend sends its manifest cache policy as `CDN-Cache-Control` too, so Vercel's CDN forwards it. Add `onBackgroundRevalidate` to the core cache and every server adapter for runtimes that stop detached work after the response.
